"EulerMethod - a GUI for Euler's method"

This project is to provide user-friendly version of approximating an ordinary differential equation (ODE) through a Java Swing GUI application. It will feature an extensible way to add in new ways of approximating Euler's method, but at this point the simple and trapezoidal Euler's method will be included. The user will be able to input their differential equation as a function of x and y, and as well input an initial point and step size and end point.
